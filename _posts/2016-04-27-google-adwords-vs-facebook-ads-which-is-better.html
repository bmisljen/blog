<p>Often times business owners who are looking to market their sites and attract new customers are bombarded with different advertising strategies with the two most popular being Google Adwords and Facebook ads.  In this post I will go over the differences between the two and which one to use in which situation.</p>
<p>Facebook ads are used to attract customers to the idea of a business or service being offered. The nice thing about them is that Facebook enables very detailed targeting of audiences so that if you are looking to target 45 year old newly divorced women who have a university degree it is completely possible. Facebook ads are generally paid week by week during an ad campaign.  Pricing generally depends on the audience size for the ad and the frequency it is shown. There are various options for Facebook ads such as trying to get the most website visits, page likes or general impressions of your business. Facebook ads work best when you are <strong>not selling </strong>a product online but instead want more people to spread the word about your business through social media circles.</p>
<p>Google Adwords, on the other hand is pay per click advertising for a specific keyword. Popular Keywords can be identified by using the Google Keyword tool.  Pricing depends on the popularity and the competitiveness for a specific keyword. More competitive popular keywords such as cell phone cases often cost a lot per click because a lot of businesses are competing for limited page space on Google. Google Adwords ads generally appear below the Google search box and on the right sidebar and are charged <strong>per user click</strong>. These types of ads are perfect for ecommerce or selling products online because they can target a very specific niche product that a potential customer might be searching Google for.  They can help launch an ecommerce business by getting customers to click through while the website is still not benefiting from natural SEO growth.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, for most non product based businesses such as: barber shops, real estate agents, lawyers, doctors, etc... Facebook ads do a better job of delivering a brand image to carefully selected potential customers. Google Adwords are very effective in their own right but are to be used in a more specific application of selling products online.</p>
