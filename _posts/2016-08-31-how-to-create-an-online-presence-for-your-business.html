<p>In today's modern and connected world it is more important than ever to create a strong online presence for your business in order to attract and retain customers and increase revenues and sales. How to create a strong online presence ? That's where I can help by giving you a completely <a href="https://www.boriswebappdevelopment.ca/#contact">free consultation </a>to get the ball rolling. In this post I will detail some of the key ways your business can expand its online presence and why they are important.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>1. Create a Company Website With a Strong Mobile Theme</strong></span></p>
<p>It goes without saying that a good company website not only helps you  communicate your businesses message to your potential customers but also helps retain existing customers by giving them useful information. In today's world  there are plenty of CMS (Content Management Systems) such as Wordpress to choose from which allow someone to modify and add to a website with no technical knowledge. Best of all, these websites are easy and cheap to set up (I do them for as little as $200) and they look slick and perform well too. A blog section is important in a businesses website because this is the area where you will want to post about on going and up and coming events and special offers to engage your customers and keep them current.</p>
<p>With smartphones and tablets dominating today's world it is critical to have a good mobile presence for your website. Luckily, most major CMS platforms such as Wordpress already support mobile themes. For a more custom high performance website, a special, high speed mobile theme can be implemented at an additional cost.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>2. Social Media Presence</strong></span></p>
<p>Social media such as: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Snapchat, Youtube and so on help you communicate your business brand to your customers. I recommend setting up pages and channels with all of these services and updating them regularly. I can also help with social media as an add on to my website services for a small additional fee. Best of all, social media can be linked to your website so that prospective clients can discover your website more easily!</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>3. Online Marketing and Advertising</strong></span></p>
<p>So you finally have this great business website and nice social media pages set up but no one knows about your business! This is a common problem that hits all startup business owners and aside from going out and pitching your business in person, it can also be done online through various services such as Google and Facebook. For more detail on which service might be right for you, please visit <a href="https://borismisljencevic.wordpress.com/2016/04/27/google-adwords-vs-facebook-ads-which-is-better/">my post</a> on online advertising.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>4. Online Newsletters and Subscriptions </strong></span></p>
<p>One great thing about having a company website with a blog is that it keeps readers interested and increases your chances of getting return customers! One good way to capitalize on this is to release a monthly newsletter to a list of subscribed customers with details on the new happenings surrounding your business. By collecting customer emails you also have a subscription list which you can use to inform them about special offers and increase your sales.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>5. List your Business  in all Available Directories </strong></span></p>
<p>Not only does listing your business in all available directories help people find it easily, it also helps your website get ranked better by Google. By directories I mean, Google Maps, Yellow Pages, Yelp, Kijijji, Craigslist, etc... By listing your business in popular places that have a high volume of web traffic you are more likely to have people find out about your business and come and check it out!</p>
<p>By following these 5 tips you are going to see a huge increase in your customer base as well as your revenues. Luckily, I can help with all of these things for a fair and reasonable price so feel free to<a href="https://www.boriswebappdevelopment.ca/#contact"> contact me</a> for a completely free consultation!</p>
