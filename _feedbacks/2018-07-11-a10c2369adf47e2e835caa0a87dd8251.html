    <br />
    Need to hire some help in regards to a GEO Location APP to see if this type of technology works or even exists.  I have developed some apps for iOS in the past but this is stumping me and is above my knowledge base. This is paid project and I am hoping to reach people in Canada since that's where I am from.<br />
    <br />
    Let me know if this something you're still into.<br />
    <br />
    Regards,<br />
