<p>I have developed a public GitHub repo containing some of the most common C++ interview questions I have compiled throughout my studying for a series of interviews last year. The C++ project developed in the CodeLite IDE contains interview questions on: Fibinocci Sequence (iterative and recursive formulas), Linked Lists (add, remove, pop, peek, list, reverse list), String Operations (reverse string, print string characters, check if a string is an anagram), Binary Trees (insert, search, destroy, print BFS, print DFS), Number Operations (LCD, GCD) , Sorting (quick, insertion, bubble sort), Double Linked Lists (add, remove, pop, peek, list, reverse list) and  Objects and Polymorphism. It runs in an easy to use menu and is completely extendable.</p>
