<p>In the past week and a half I have developed an Android based prayer app for a local client fromÂ Fredericton, New Brunswick. The idea of the app is to display random biblical prayers that change when swiped. Two thumb prints appear at the bottom of the screen which when pressed display a prayer message. Prayers can also be saved to a list of favorite prayers, edited and reloaded at a later time. The app is simple, easy to use and best of all, free. It enables quick and easy prayers to be loaded on the go with no hassle.</p>
<p>To download the app and view more screenshots please check it out at the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dennis.powerprayer&amp;hl=en">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
