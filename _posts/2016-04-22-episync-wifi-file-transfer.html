<p>Episync is an Android and PC (Mac, Linux, Windows) file transfer and syncing app that was created by myself (Boris Misljencevic) and a fellow student while studying engineering at Carleton University. The idea for the app came about when my phone USB port was broken and was not recognizing my computer when I wanted to transfer files between devices. I realized that the optimal solution to this problem was to implement a wireless transfer between phone and PC.  This would not only fix my problem, but it would also allow me to not carry my phone cable everywhere I go in order to transfer and sync files.</p>
<p>When designing the app we chose to use Wifi as our medium of transfer between devices as it was easy and readily available to most all people. With the basic architecture set in place we decided to make the PC app a multi-threaded Java application using Swing for the GUI components as it was cross platform compatible. The app was to be made for Android first and then iOS second. We started off with a one folder PC to phone and phone to PC file transfer and sync and then we gradually improved the app to support multiple directories and files at the same time.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our graduating school year we applied to a startup incubator and received funding for our idea from an angel investor associated with Carleton University in Ottawa Canada. We spent one summer developing Episync further and pitching it to clients and investors. We are still developing the app at the moment and watching it grow and acquire a larger user base as it matures.</p>
<p>Overall Episync was a great learning experience as we improved our software design and development skills while learning how to start a business from the ground up. We learned how to create and market business plans as well as how to pitch our idea and execute technical demonstrations to potential customers.</p>
