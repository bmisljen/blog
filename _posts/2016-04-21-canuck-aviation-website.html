<p>One of my passions is aviation and I hold a commercial pilot license and a flight instructor rating. I have created a website about flight training and how to become a pilot using the Wordpress CMS hosted on a shared Bluehost web server. The website was created with a Customizr free Wordpress theme and has integration with Google Adsense, Google Analytics, Webmaster tools as well as being registered on the Amazon Affiliates program.  The website runs of a customized child theme and utilizes various plugins for SEO, caching, photographic albums, picture and video compression, spam blockers and much more.  So far it has been a fun project and the traffic rates keep increasing every month.</p>
<p>The website is available at: <a href="https://canuckaviation.com/">https://canuckaviation.com/</a></p>
