<p>I have just completed a Shopify ECommerce store for a client based in Fredericton, NB for his newly launched spice business. It has truly been a great experience and I got to improve my skills with Shopify sites and the spice business as a whole. The business, (<a href="https://www.masterindianspice.com/">https://www.masterindianspice.com/</a>) Â called Master Indian Spice sells pre-packaged spices along with instructions to create popular, great tasting Indian dishes with ease at home.</p>
<p>I managed to set up the store in just a few days and it is up and running and functioning well, just having received its first few orders. I truly do believe that Shopify is one of the best and easiest to use ecommerce platforms and is totally worth the money.</p>
<p>For anyone interested in my Shopify ecommerce website solutions my rates start at $500 and I can get your site up and running in less than a week. <a href="https://borismisljencevic.wordpress.com/contact/">Contact me</a> for more details or to book a free consultation!</p>
