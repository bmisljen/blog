<p>Many people when starting a new business setup a beautiful website and then wait for the clients to come pouring in. After a few months they realize not as many people are visiting their site as they had anticipated. Following this they often get down on themselves and start wondering why this is happening.  The reality of the matter is that most people who search for services or products do so through search engines like Google. Now Google ranks websites with a lot of visitors highly and they appear as the top search results which are also the sites to get visited by new visitors the most often. New websites without visitors rank low and they get slotted in in some far away page of the search results. The ever so important question is that if a website needs to be ranked well to get traffic and a website needs traffic to be ranked well how can this be achieved? The answer is with a lot of hard work, some money and a good deal of patience. In this article I will go over 5 things that you can do to your site to increase the number of visitors flowing in each month.</p>
<p><strong>Number One: Use Social Media </strong></p>
<p>Social media such as: Facebook, Google +, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube,  etc... promotes your business as a brand to potential customers. Furthermore, it allows you to engage potential users by as many different channels as possible and it in turn drives more traffic towards your site.  One example of this would be getting your friends to like your Facebook page for your business and then occasionally posting articles on it to keep people in the loop about your business and to attract new customers.</p>
<p>Another added advantage of social media is that it can be used for paid advertising</a>. This type of advertising targets a certain audience and can drive traffic to your website or social media page based on a specified demographics outside of your friend group.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Number Two: Use Google Maps</strong></p>
<p>Registering a business on Google Maps not only ranks your website better on Google Search but it also allows people to see where your business is physically located and what your hours and contact info are on the most popular map app in the world. Registering a business with Google Maps is completely free, all that is required is an address of your business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Number Three: Post to Your Site Often With Unique Content</strong></p>
<p>Google search rankings like sites with a lot of original content that gets updated frequently. The more original, well thought out articles you post to your site, the higher the site will be ranked and the more visitors you will get. The <a href="https://adwords.google.ca/KeywordPlanner">Google Keywords</a> tool can be used to search popularly searched keywords for your articles. Popular widely searched keywords in articles attract more visitors especially long tail specific keywords with multiple phrases.  Posts to the site should not be too short or simple and should convey actual value to the reader so time must be taken to do a good job of writing them.</p>
<p>One way to post often is to add a "blog" or "news" section to your site and to update it weekly or even daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Number Four: Optimize Your Sites Performance</strong></p>
<p>Sites that are friendly for mobile devices and that load quickly and have no broken links are ranked highly by Google. The <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Page Speed Insights</a> tool by Google rates your website based on tests for both mobile and desktop page loading speed and reports on any possible improvements. Various CMS (Content Management System) platforms such as Wordpress have some very useful plugins for caching, SEO, and compressing images.  These plugin all help speed up the loading time of your site and result in a better ranking. Ensuring that there are no broken or dead links leading to nowhere is also important because Google wants a nice and clean website that is easy to understand.</p>
<p>Finally, some websites benefit from having a purely mobile theme that is seperate from the desktop theme instead of using one shared mobile and desktop theme.  These websites usually load with an m at the front such as m.facebook.com. The advantage of doing this is that the mobile website can be custom designed to be simpler and to include less content to improve its readability and loading speed on mobile devices. The downside of this of course is the cost and effort involved to create a standalone mobile website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Number Five: Post on Popular Websites and Forums</strong></p>
<p>If you follow a popular forum or blog with a lot of visitors that has a similar topic as you posted it is helpful to write a constructive non-spammy comment mentioning your article with a link to your site.  This is a free way of promoting yourself and your site in a high traffic area which can potentially lead to more visitors seeing your site. One thing to note though is that often times forums and blogs block links and they may spam your comment from appearing to other guests reading that particular article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These five steps are just an idea to get you started on getting more visitors. I want to emphasize once again that there are no overnight success stories when it comes to web traffic and rankings but eventually hard work and patience does pay off.</p>
