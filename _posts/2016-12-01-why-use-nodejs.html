<p>In the past few weeks I have been learning Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io and Mongo DB by following <a href="https://github.com/bmisljen/nodeschoolproblems">Nodeschool.io</a> tutorials as well as working on my own <a href="https://github.com/bmisljen/Node.js-Ultimate-Chatroom">chat and file transer</a> application. I decided to learn Node.js because I was reading about all the hype it was getting and wanted to find out for myself.</p>
<p>Node.js is a non blocking event driven server-side Javascript environment which brings Javascript to the back end. With Node.js it is possible to make full front to back web apps as well as desktop apps; something which Javascript was never known for. Additionally, it is event driven or asynchronous which means that time consuming actions such as loading files from the filesystem and making I/O calls are all done in the background allowing for a faster and more fluid user experience.</p>
<p>Node.js is completely free and open source and it comes with npm, an easy to use open source package browser where you can install additional Node.js modules such as Socket.io and Express.js. Installation of a new modules is as simple as: "npm install express". Express.js is the most popular Node.js web app framework which makes creating web apps a breeze. Socket.io is a module which allows real time event based communication accross platforms. This is especially useful for chat or file transfer apps like the one that I am building. Finally, Mongo DB is an open source NoSQL database which is exceptionally fast and is useful for social media sites and storing user data.</p>
<p>Node.js is truly revolutionary as it brings all the advantages of Javascript to the server and desktop side to make cross platform apps. It is exceptionally fast and open source which is nice because of the wealth of packages available. It is ideally suited for projects involving: chat, file transfer, social media, video streaming, work collaboration and much more.</p>
<p>I will continue making my chat and file transfer app and will post more updates as it nears completion!</p>
